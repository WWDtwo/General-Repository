                    <p>The Purple Line is a light rail that will run directly through the University of Maryland upon its completion. With five stations soon to be located on campus, it has been the primary cause for the constant state of construction. The light rail so far has some glaring flaws.</p>
                    <p>A seemingly common misconception is that a full metro train will run through the campus, but that is not the case. Rather, the tracks are meant for something closer to a trolley than a train, meant for transportation to and from existing Metro and Amtrak stations. It is effectively a shuttle bus on rails.</p>

                    <p>One issue that has already presented itself is debris within the tracks. Small rocks and pebbles tend to get stuck in the parts of the rails that are completed and exposed to everyday foot traffic. Unlike a metro train, the tracks for the light rail are embedded into the ground, instead of having two rails laid over top of the ground. Because the light rail will run on the rails every day, debris will not be able to accumulate within the grooves as much as it has, although it is unreasonable to assume that there will be no debris at all. The grooves themselves are roughly two inches deep, leaving a slim margin of error for debris accumulation. Some cities, such as Chur, Switzerland, have addressed the issue of rubble by forgoing the tracks entirely. Trolleys in Chur are just large buses connected to a transit line which run through the city.</p>

            <h2>Light Rail vs. Bus</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="large-8 medium-6 small-12 cell">
            <div class="copy-container">
                <div class="body-copy">
                    <p>The two advantages that light rails have over buses are their superior range and lack of adherence to traffic. But the very fact that the tracks run through one of the main University roads negates the latter benefit. College campuses have notorious foot traffic, with buses frequently having to stop for swaths of students crossing the road at various points. And while it is easy for a bus with tires to stop within a distance of about two yards, it might prove more difficult to do so with a light rail car. In order to prevent becoming an active safety risk, the light rail car would have to operate at a much slower speed than normal while going through the campus. According to the Minnesota Safety Council, it takes a light rail car about 600 feet to stop when going full speed. Far quicker than a full sized metro train, sure, but 600 feet is nearly the distance between from Edward St. John Hall to Knight Hall. As a result, the light rail car would have to travel slower than the bus in order to retain efficient emergency braking capabilities. As such, there are spots on campus where it would likely be quicker to take the bus to the College Park Metro station than the light rail.</p>
                    <p>The light rail does not just run through College Park: it has service all the way to New Carrollton, spanning the width of the Nationâ€™s Capital. Very convenient, and certainly more capable than the UMD shuttles, but the Metro also runs service to New Carrollton via the Orange line, and as we have established there are at least a few spots where a bus would get to the College Park Metro station more efficiently than the light rail would. It is true that getting to New Carrollton from College Park station requires changing lines within DC, and riding the Metro can be a hassle in general, but it still has the advantage of speed over the light rail. It is true that the Purple line stops at multiple stations, but then so does the Metro.</p>

            <h2>The Airport Benefit</h2>
        </div>

                    <p>There is one function that the Purple line serves that puts it head and shoulders over all other modes of public transportation: getting to and from the airport. The Purple line runs service to BWI Airport, and it will logically be the single best way for anybody living remotely close to the line to get there. Driving your car to the airport requires you to park for a prolonged period of time, racking up fees and creating a hassle when you have returned from your trip and you fight through the post-flight brain fog to find your car. Buses can only be so large, so your luggage sometimes ends up on your lap as you bump along to the airport. But a light rail train can have multiple cars, giving you some breathing room with your luggage, and runs a person far less money than a five-day parking fee.</p>
                    <p>The Purple line is slated for a 2026 completion date, so any analysis on its efficiency at this point is just conjecture.</p>
